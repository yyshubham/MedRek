# The problem it solves

      ○ When it comes to the field of health care, there are problems related to communication of medical data between the doctor and patients.

      ○ In order to diagnose the symptoms of a persisting disease, a record of previous medical data can be extremely helpful to examine the effects & results of different        medication and tests on a patient.

      ○ If we discuss diseases and whatever treatment a patient undergoes with a doctor, there is not a surety that the patient will continue his treatment by that same clinic/doctor.

      ○ It is quite common for patients to change their doctor/clinic, due to various reasons, while undergoing certain treatment; this can lead to data loss. Therefore, keeping a record/track of the medical history is a necessity while migration of treatments.

      ○ There is a communication gap between doctor and patient while explaining the medical terms of the treatment in a clean and concise way.

    ➤ We have come up with a Hack which allows the current doctors to view and analyse the medical history of patients.

    ○ The doctors can view the past medical history as well as add the details regarding the current undergoing treatment.

          The past details include:

          Time period of the entire treatment
          The doctor who treated the past illness
          Tests undergone
          Their Reports
          The medicines and complete treatment details regarding the same
          ○ The patient shall generate a QR code and share it with the doctor. The doctor can scan it and all the past medical data of the patient will be available to the doctor.

    ○ With the help of this app, not only the doctor can view old data but he can also add new prescriptions and reports on the go.
    Consequently, the patient will be updated of the prescriptions instantly.

    ○ This hereby also provides a way of going contactless in healthcare. The medical prescriptions and comments, instead of using pen and paper while going directly to the clinic, can directly be presented before the patient.
